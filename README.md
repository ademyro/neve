# Neve
Neve is a modern, hybrid-paradigm programming language designed to deliver reliability through static typing, whiel providing users a soothing* syntax to work with.

## Example
```rb
fun main
  let my_tea = Tea with
    herbs = Herbs.Chamomile 
  end

  my_tea.brew
end
```

* Syntactical aesthetics are ultimately subjective, and Neve's syntax may not be considered 'soothing' by everyone.
